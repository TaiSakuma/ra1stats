SMS
remove hard-coded HT thresholds in smsHistoSpec(), smsXsHisto(), smsNeventsInHisto()
consider hard-coded CLb_2 in plottingGrid.clsValidation()

check signal efficiency merging
separate eff unc. for hadrons and muons

technical
---------
fix leaks in pValue() and expectedLimit()
plot FC belt
tweak FC running
query fit status for toys (improve 0 cut)
