hard-coded
----------
- remove hard-coded HT thresholds in histoSpec(), xsHisto(), nEventsInHisto()
- consider hard-coded CLb_2 in plottingGrid.clsValidation()
- 0.95 in StandardHypoTestInvDemo.C

one
---
- treatment of global observables
- range for par f
- gaussian counts
- errors on translation factors
- view call graph to speed up cmssm initialization

two
---
- signal injection studies
- SMS combo studies
- slope of excl. curve for low LSP mass
- binary vs. upper limit study

three
-----
- debug page 3 of cls plot
- bin-by-bin systematics on signal eff.
- upgrade dirac delta
- check signal efficiency merging
- separate eff unc. for hadrons and muons
- restore extraSigEffSources
- mcStatErr before trigger
- parHistos 2D ensemble

four
----
- remove syst. encouragement
- rho vs. HT
- automatic N_bins, N_nuisance
- store workspace / profile wrapper
- fix leaks in ensemble() and expectedLimit()
- query fit status for toys (improve 0 cut)
- (2D) pickling.stuffVars
- (2D) more histos in check
- (2D) all sms function in histogramSpecs and histogramProcessing
- (2D) trigger efficiency uncertainty
- (2D) consider seed
- (2D) consider removing PROD

speed-ups for toys
------------------
(options)
- reduce rate of freaks
- look around less
- faster evaluation

(technical)
- grid
- qcd parameterization (also document)
- profile
- minuit config: strategy, nFCNCallsMax
- initial values/ranges
- flatten pdf
- 10 --> 7

(physics)
- fewer bins
- RaT vs. HT
