physics
-------
- error propagation in plots
- trigger efficiency in signal efficiency
- correction to signal efficiency central value
- improve mc ratio
- mc stats as systematic
- bin-by-bin systematics on signal eff.
- nlo scale variations
- upgrade dirac delta
- lognormal vs. gaussian
- check signal efficiency merging
- separate eff unc. for hadrons and muons

hard-coded
----------
- remove hard-coded HT thresholds in histoSpec(), xsHisto(), nEventsInHisto()
- consider hard-coded CLb_2 in plottingGrid.clsValidation()
- 0.95 in StandardHypoTestInvDemo.C

technical
---------
- fix leaks in pValue() and expectedLimit()
- query fit status for toys (improve 0 cut)

2D
---
- pickling.stuffVars
- more histos in check
- all sms function in histogramSpecs and histogramProcessing
- trigger efficiency uncertainty
- consider seed
- signalExampleToStack
- consider removing PROD
- signal efficiency toggle
